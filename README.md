# Neural Machine Translation with mT5: Opus Books en-fr Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a neural machine translation project using the mT5 (Multilingual Translation Transformer) model with the Opus Books English-to-French (en-fr) dataset. The goal is to develop a sophisticated translation system leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.

## Objectives

- Utilize the mT5 model for English-to-French translation.
- Train and fine-tune the model on the Opus Books en-fr dataset.
- Evaluate the translation performance using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset

The Opus Books English-to-French dataset is used for training and evaluation. It includes a diverse collection of texts from books, making it suitable for a wide range of translation tasks.

## Model

The mT5 (Multilingual Translation Transformer) model is employed for its multilingual capabilities and effectiveness in translation tasks.
